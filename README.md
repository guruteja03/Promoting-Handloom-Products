# Handloom Heritage Prototype

## How to save the files

1. Create a folder named `handloom-prototype`.
2. Inside it, create subfolders `css`, `js`, `images`.
3. Save `index.html`, `about.html`, `products.html` in the root folder.
4. Save `style.css` inside `css` folder.
5. Save `main.js` inside `js` folder.
6. Put image files into the `images` folder (you’ll need images like hero background, product images, logo, etc.)

## How to run

- You don’t need a server for this basic prototype. Just open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right click → Open With).
- If you want to work in a more realistic dev environment, you can use a simple HTTP server, e.g.:

  - If you have Python installed:

    ```bash
    cd handloom-prototype
    # For Python 3.x
    python3 -m http.server 8000
    ```

    Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

  - Or use VSCode + Live Server extension.

- To deploy, you can upload to static hosting like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.

If you want all the functionality (e.g. filtering products, dynamic content, animations, responsive breakpoints etc.), I can provide that too. Do you want me to prepare full code (with e.g. React/Vue) or just static HTML/CSS/JS like above?
